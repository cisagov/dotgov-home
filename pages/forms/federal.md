To the .gov Program:

As [authorizing authority]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#federal-domains) for [Agency Name], I request that responsibility for the domain name [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov\] be delegated to my organization.

[*Briefly describe your agency's mission or initiative that drives the domain name request, explaining what the domain name will be used for.*]

In order to obtain and maintain [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov] [Agency Name] will meet the general and specific requirements for federal agencies, found at [https://get.gov/registration/requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/).

The following will be listed as contacts for [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov], which [Agency Name] will keep up to date in the .gov registrar.
