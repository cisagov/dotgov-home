To the .gov Program:

As [authorizing authority]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#city-and-county-domains) for [City/County], I request that responsibility for the domain name [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov] be delegated to my municipality.

[*Briefly describe the mission or initiative that drives the domain name request, explaining what the domain name will be used for.*]

In order to obtain and maintain [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov] [City/County] will meet the general and specific requirements for federal agencies, found at [https://get.gov/registration/requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/).

The following will be listed as contacts for [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov], which [City/County] will keep up to date in the .gov registrar.

[*Administrative and technical contacts are named individuals and must be unique; a security contact should generally be a team email address.*]
