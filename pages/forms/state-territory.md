[State/Territory government letterhead]

.Gov Domain Registration\
c/o Verisign, Inc.\
12061 Bluemont Way\
Reston, Virginia 20190

To the .gov Program:

As [[authorizing authority]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#state-and-us-territory-domains)] for [Agency Name], I request that responsibility for the domain name [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov] be delegated to [Organization].

[*Briefly describe your organization's mission or initiative that drives the domain name request, explaining what the domain name will be used for.*]

In order to obtain and maintain [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov] [Organization] will meet the general and specific requirements for federal agencies, found at [https://home.dotgov.gov/registration/requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/).

The following will be listed as contacts for [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov], which [Organization] will keep up to date in the .gov registrar.

[*Administrative, billing, and technical contacts are named individuals and must be unique; a security contact should generally be a team email address.*

*As of April 26, 2021, .gov domains no longer have a fee associated with them. However, the .gov registrar has not yet been updated to remove the billing contact role. Until then, you may consider the billing contact to be a secondary administrative contact.*]
