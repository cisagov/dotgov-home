[*Briefly describe your organization's mission or initiative that drives the domain name request, explaining what the domain name will be used for.*]

In order to obtain and maintain [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov] [Organization] will meet the general and specific requirements for federal agencies, found at [https://get.gov/registration/requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/).

The following will be listed as contacts for [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov], which [Organization] will keep up to date in the .gov registrar.
