## Frequently asked questions

Your domain is central to your organization's brand and availability over the internet. It's also key to your security, and that of your users. We've outlined answers to common questions below.

We also recommend you review our [domain security best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/security-best-practices/) page.

### Domain registration FAQ
#### Who can obtain a .gov domain and what are the requirements?

The [Eligibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#eligibility) section of our [domain requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/) says:

> *Only U.S.-based government and public sector organizations are eligible to obtain a .gov domain. This includes any federal, state, local, or territorial government entity, or other publicly controlled entity. It also includes any tribal government recognized by the federal government or a state government. Eligibility is determined by the DotGov Program, which will be informed by the United States Census Bureau’s [criteria for classifying governments](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology/population-of-interest1.html).*

The requirements specify the *general* requirements that all domain registrants need to follow, as well as the *specific* requirements for the different [domain types](#whats-an-authorizing-authority-and-who-is-mine), or kinds of government organizations. The specific requirements outline additional requirements (where applicable), but the key detail is that they describe who your "authorizing authority" is, or the official we'll accept as signatory for your .gov domain request.

#### What does a .gov domain cost?
Domains are available [at no cost]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/4/27/a-new-day-for-gov/) to qualifying U.S.-based government organizations.

However, it takes more than simply a domain name to put your organization on the internet, and [we do not currently provide hosting services](#do-you-provide-dns-hosting-for-gov-domains) for registrants.

#### What's an "authorizing authority", and who is ours?

The authorizing authority is the official we'll accept as signatory for your .gov domain request. To determine who yours is, _evaluate what kind of government organization you are_ and follow the link (which will take you to the relevant section of our [domain requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/)):

1. [Federal]({{site.baseurl}}/registration/requirements/#federal-domains): Federal agencies from all three branches of the federal government
2. [Native sovereign nation (tribal)]({{site.baseurl}}/registration/requirements/#native-sovereign-nation-tribal-domains): Tribal governments recognized by the federal government or a state government
3. [State/U.S. territories]({{site.baseurl}}/registration/requirements/#state-and-us-territory-domains): 50 U.S. states, District of Columbia (D.C.), American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands
4. [Interstate]({{site.baseurl}}/registration/requirements/#interstate-domains): An organization of two or more states. From our domain requirements:
> _Interstate (multi-state) governmental organizations are most frequently formed via legislation from Congress or from a legal accord between, or passed by, the state governments of two or more states. Examples include multi-state commissions, organizations that manage interstate compacts, or port authorities that operate across jurisdictions._

5. [Independent intrastate]({{site.baseurl}}/registration/requirements/#independent-intrastate-domains): An autonomous organization of a single state. From our domain requirements:
> _Independent intrastate (within a single state) governmental organizations are most frequently formed via state or local legislation, where authority is vested in them to operate fully or quasi-independently from the state. Examples include organizations authorized by law that operate a jurisdiction’s elections, manage regional transit, or do area-wide economic planning with governance independent from e.g., the executive branch."_

6. [City/County]({{site.baseurl}}/registration/requirements/#city-and-county-domains): Cities, towns, villages, counties, parishes, borough, or equivalents

##### We're an elections office. Who is our authorizing authority?

In general, elections offices maintain legal or practical autonomy from a municipality. Elections offices should follow the requirements for [independent intrastate]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#independent-intrastate-domains) domains. The authorization authority is the highest election official. For state-level election offices, the authorizing authority is typically the state's chief election official. For local-level election offices, the highest level election official is typically the elected or appointed official that runs the office.

##### We're a school district. Can we get a .gov domain?
School districts that meet the characteristics of a 'school district government', as described in the [U.S. Census Bureau's classification of government units](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/econ/2017isd.html), may request a .gov domain. School districts that are _dependent entities_ of local governments may not request a .gov domain, but their parent government (e.g., the county) may request one on their behalf.

For details about school district governments, see the section "School District Governments and Public School Systems" in [Individual State Descriptions: 2017 Census of Governments](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/econ/2017isd.pdf#page=12) (PDF pg. 12) and your individual state description.

School district governments are subject to the registration requirements for [independent intrastate]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#independent-intrastate-domains) domains. So, for school district governments, the authorizing authority is the highest-ranking executive, e.g., the chair of a school district's board or the superintendent.

#### What contact information do we need to keep updated?

Domain name registrants [must]({{site.baseurl}}/registration/requirements/#required-activities) keep names, email addresses, and phone numbers current for *administrative* and *technical* contacts. In general:

1. An **administrative contact** is the person who controls or approves content on the domain and is the manager of operations for the domain.

2. A **technical contact** is the person who directly manages or operates your DNS.

Administrative and technical contacts have accounts to the .gov registrar and can make changes to your DNS nameservers.

A **[security contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/security-best-practices/#add-a-security-contact)** is a recommended practice. It should be added to allow the public to report observed or suspected security issues at your domain. *Security contact details are made public.* We recommend using an alias, like `security@<domain.gov>`.

> **Note**: The security contact role *does not* have an account to the .gov registrar.

At present, we don't allow a single person to serve as more than one contact - meaning that two distinct contacts are required. (This does *not* apply to security contact.)

### Domain names FAQ

#### How many domains can I request?
#### What should we consider when selecting a domain name?

#### How do I request an exception to the naming requirements?

Exceptions to the [naming requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#naming-requirements) can be requested in your authorization letter. For cities and counties, we have [outlined some circumstances]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#city-and-county-exception-requests) where we may grant an exception.

#### What are the valid characters for a domain name?

The only valid characters for a domain name are letters, numbers, and a hyphen. Other characters, including a space, are not permitted. Domain names may not begin or end with a hyphen.

***

### DNS FAQ

#### What are the .gov TLD's name servers?

`[a-d].gov-servers.net` are .gov's authoritative name servers.

#### Do you provide DNS hosting for .gov domains?

No. We manage the authoritative name servers for the .gov zone. We don't operate a managed DNS hosting service – nor do we offer web hosting, email services, or certificates.

Many DNS hosting service providers exist. Your technical support team may also manage authoritative DNS for you.

#### What are the name server requirements for .gov domains?

* You must define a primary and secondary name server in the [.gov registrar](https://domains.dotgov.gov).
* You may not specify an IP address for your name servers unless they are child name servers of the domain you’re trying to register or update.

If we authorize your requested domain name, we query your name server addresses for an authoritative response for NS and SOA records.

#### Why won’t my domain work after updating my request with name server addresses?

Adding name server addresses to a requested domain does not change its status from *requested* to *active* if other requirements are pending (for example, CISA's review of the domain).

#### How quickly will changes to my domain propagate throughout the internet?

Propagation depends on a variety of factors, but changes are usually effective within 24 hours.

If you’re planning to make critical changes to your name servers over the weekend, please [contact us](#contact-us) before 5 p.m. the Thursday before to ensure the information propagates during weekend hours.

#### Will I be notified if a change is made to my DNS information?

Yes. Your domain contacts will receive an automated email when a change is made in the .gov registrar to their name server addresses.

#### When can I define my DS record?

You can define Delegation Signer (DS) records during registration or after the domain name is active. Before your DS records are published in the .gov zone, they will be tested and verified.

***

### Contact information FAQ
#### How do I change a contact for my domain?

A current contact should [contact us](#contact-us) to establish a new user account. If all contacts are unavailable (e.g., they've left the organization), the [authorizing authority](#whats-an-authorizing-authority-and-who-is-ours) must sign a new authorization letter and assign new domain contacts.

#### Can one person serve as contacts on a single domain?

No. At present, we don't allow a single person to serve as more than one contact – meaning that two distinct contacts are required. (This does *not* apply to security contact.)

#### Can a person serve as a contact on multiple domains?

Yes.

***

### Renewals, transfers, and deletions FAQ
#### How long is a .gov domain registered for?

One year. (Domain contacts will receive several reminder emails before expiration.)

#### How do I delete my domain?

If you'd like to delete a domain name, [contact us](#contact-us). Once completed, you should ask your DNS provider to remove your domain's authoritative DNS nameservers.

**Danger**: once a domain is deleted, the [registration process]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/) must be started again to obtain the domain. *Be certain you want to delete a domain before contacting us!*

#### How do I transfer my domain to a different agency?

To transfer ownership of a domain name from one federal agency to another agency, two letters must be submitted to us: one from the *transferring* agency and one from the *receiving* agency.

Whether transferring or receiving, start by copying and pasting the [domain transfer letter template]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/authorization-templates/transfers/) into a document editor. The letter from both agencies must be on official agency letterhead and signed by the respecting authorizing authority. Once prepared, each agency emails their authorization letter to <registrar@dotgov.gov>. After we receive and verify both letters, the registry will be updated to reflect the transfer.

#### What happens if I do not renew my domain name?

Failure to submit updated contact information does not result in the immediate termination of your domain. However, it may be placed in a hold status. When a domain name is held, it ceases resolving in DNS, making all services attached to the domain inaccessible by name resolution.

If you do not wish to renew, please contact us to [delete your domain]({{ site.baseurl }}#how-do-i-delete-my-domain).
