### Why use .gov?

.gov is a 'top-level domain', or TLD, similar to _.com_, _.org_, or _.us_. Individuals and enterprises use a TLD to register a domain name (often simply called a _domain_) for use in their online services, like a website or email.

In many well-known TLDs, anyone can register a domain for a fee, and as long as they pay there aren't many questions asked about whether the name they chose corresponds to their real-life name or services. While this can be a useful property for creative communication, it can also make it difficult to know whether the people behind a name are _really_ who they claim to be.

**It should be easy to identify governments on the internet**, and using a .gov domain shows you’re official. The public shouldn't have to guess whether the site they're on or the email that hits their inbox is genuine.

[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, [sponsors the .gov TLD](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/gov.html) and makes it available _solely_ to U.S.-based government organizations and publicly controlled entities. For those that qualify for a .gov domain, it's available without a fee.

### What does .gov do?

We make it easy to register a .gov domain name and ensure that the name resolves in the global domain name system ([DNS]( {{  site.baseurl }}/help/#dns)). DNS maps easy-to-remember names on top of hard-to-recall numbers, allowing you to use `cisa.gov` instead of something like `104.106.178.124`.

.gov domains are intertwined with access to public services. That makes the .gov TLD _critical infrastructure_ for governments, citizens, and international internet users. We work to **make .gov a trusted, secure space** by:  

* administering our [domain requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/),
* publishing the [complete list of .gov domains]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/),
* recommending [security best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/security-best-practices/), and
* implementing [key initiatives]( {{site.baseurl }}/2020/6/21/an-intent-to-preload/) to protect the entire namespace.

We put U.S. governments on the internet, but there are some things we *don’t* do. We don't offer authoritative DNS services, host .gov websites or email, or monitor all .gov network traffic.
