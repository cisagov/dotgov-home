<h1>The .gov registrar is moving</h1>

We are moving the .gov registrar to new technical infrastructure. At this
time, you can’t request a new .gov domain or manage your existing .gov
domains, but <strong>DNS for existing domains will not change and will still resolve
online</strong>. We anticipate being back online by Friday, November 17, 2023. Email <a href="mailto:help@get.gov">help@get.gov</a> with questions.


**New .gov domain requests**:You’ll be able to request a new .gov domain in January 2024. Find out <a
href="https://beta.get.gov/domains/before/">what you’ll need to request a .gov</a>.


**Thank you for your patience as we launch a new .gov registrar!** Visit <a href="https://beta.get.gov">beta.get.gov</a> to preview the
changes coming to .gov.
