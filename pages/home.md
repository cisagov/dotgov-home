<h1>The .gov registrar is moving</h1>

<p>We are moving the .gov registrar to new technical infrastructure. At this
time, you can’t request a new .gov domain or manage your existing .gov
domains, but DNS for existing domains will not change and will still resolve
online. Email <a href="mailto:help@get.gov">help@get.gov</a> with questions.
Visit our <a href="https://beta.get.gov">beta.get.gov</a> site to preview the
changes coming to .gov.
</p>

<h2>Domain management</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to manage your existing .gov domains in our new registrar on November 17, 2024.</p>

<h2>New .gov domain requests</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to request a new .gov domain in January 2024. Find out <a
href="https://beta.get.gov/domains/before/">what you’ll need to request a
.gov</a> in our new registrar.</p>


<p><br/>Thank you for your patience as we launch a new .gov registrar!</p>
