### 2023

**January 31st, 2023**: The .gov zone file is [now available](https://czds.icann.org/home) in ICANN's Centralized Zone Data Service. [Learn more]({{ site.baseurl }}/updates/2022/9/14/making-infrastructure-less-invisible/#publishing-the-gov-zone-file) in last September's blog post.

### 2022

* *September 14th:* **[Making infrastructure less invisible]({{ site.baseurl }}/updates/2022/9/14/making-infrastructure-less-invisible)**. Invisible consistency tends to be a trait of good infrastructure, but it doesn't have to be hidden.

### 2021

* *July 21st:* **[About .gov, for elections]({{ site.baseurl}}/about/elections)**. We've added a page to help the election community learn about .gov.

* *June 30:* **[A request for information](https://sam.gov/opp/78749b4fc58145568148dbdecfa83f6d/view)**. We released an RFI to gather feedback on our objectives for .gov's next phase.

* *April 27:* **[A new day for .gov]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/4/27/a-new-day-for-gov/)**. Domains are available to qualifying U.S.-based government organizations *at no cost*, and the registration requirements have been updated.

* *March 8:* **[.gov is moving to CISA]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/3/8/moving-to-cisa/)**. The .gov TLD is moving to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

### 2020
* *June 21:* **[An intent to preload]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/6/21/an-intent-to-preload/)**. HSTS preloading can protect individual domains names, but it can also be applied to a top-level domain.

### 2019
* *July 17:* **[DNS change notifications]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/#will-i-be-notified-if-a-change-is-made-to-my-dns-information)**. Authorized .gov domain contacts will receive a system-generated email when a change is made to their DNS in the .gov registrar.

### 2018
* *October 29:* **[GSA steps up security for .gov](https://digital.gov/2018/10/29/gsa-steps-up-security-for-dotgov/)**. This guest post on digital.gov summarized many of this year's activities.
* *October 1:* **[Doing the 2-step]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018/10/1/doing-the-2-step/)**. We added a new feature – and made it mandatory – to improve the security of .gov registrar accounts.
* *August 21:* **[Opt-in to preload your domains]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/preloading/)**. New .gov domains can opt-in to HSTS preloading at the time of registration.

* *April 17:* **[Increasing the security of passwords](/2018/4/17/increase-security-passwords/)**. We minimize the threat of password reuse by ensuring that passwords found in data taken from past public breaches cannot be used.

### 2017
* *January 19:* **[Automatic HTTPS enforcement for new executive branch .gov domains](https://www.cio.gov/2017/01/19/automatic-https.html)**. A guest post on cio.gov. As new executive branch domains are registered, they will be submitted to web browsers for “preloading.”
