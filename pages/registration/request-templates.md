Choose an authorization letter template to copy and paste from:

* [City/County]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/city-county/)
* [Federal]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/federal/)
* [State/U.S. territory]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/state-territory/)
* [Tribal]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/tribal)
* [Interstate]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/interstate/)
* [Independent intrastate]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/independent-intrastate/)

*Unsure which letter to select?* Check out the FAQ, [What's an "authorizing authority", and who is ours?]({{site.basurl}}/help/#whats-an-authorizing-authority-and-who-is-ours) for a breakdown of each domain type.

CISA will share approved authorization letters submitted by the authorizing authority with the U.S. Census Bureau, including letters that have already been collected by CISA.
