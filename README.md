## The .gov website

A site for the .gov program, circa 2017 - 2024. We're now at https://github.com/cisagov/get.gov.

### Built using

* The [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov), a set of reusable, high quality components for modern websites. Maintains consistency with the [many other U.S. government websites using the Standards](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/blob/develop/docs/WHO_IS_USING_USWDS.md).

* The U.S. Web Design Standards [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll). A few of the components have been overwritten or customized, but the theme is in use.

### Developing locally

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby-based static site generator.

The application is optimized for deployment on 18F's [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) static site hosting service.

Install dependencies with Bundler:

```
bundle install
```

And run the site with Jekyll:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If all goes well, visit the site at `http://localhost:4000`.
